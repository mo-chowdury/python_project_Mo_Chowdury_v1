Read the following article to assist with setting up the virtual environment
and installing Flask to your python file.

Once you have installed and set up the virtual environment, you will need to create a folder called "templates" (lowercase)
You will also need to create a folder called "static" and inside create 2 more folders "js" and "css"(all lowercase)

The templates folder will contain the HTML files you will need for the different routes you will build in python.
To display the relevant sheet, you will end up using "render" from Flask, this will direct your app to the HTML page to load

In regards to HTML files you will start with a "base.html" file and for all other pages the first line of code needed
will be {{% extends base.html %}}. This odd looking syntax is called templating and is avaliable via Flask, which has
a templating language intergrated into it called Jinja.

The templates will allow you to use python methods inside of the HTML files.

A basic structure for using templates will be the block and endblock e.g.
{{% block css % }}
    links containing css in here - these are both internal and external css files
{{% endblock %}}

The above would typically be found on the base.html page. 


We would also have the same structure for the main content e.g.:
{{% block content %}}
    all page content will appear between these template tags
{{% endblock %}}

The content tags would contain the content for the landing page on the base.html page, but in other pages
where we start with our {{% extends base.html %}} line we will write the content relevant for that page.

By rewriting the content template tags on these pages we can "re-route" the content that was previously found 
on the base.html page and displays content for the new page (endpoint).

e.g. The page below would display a basic registration page containing a form:

{{% extends base.html %}}
{{% block content %}}

    <div>
        <form>
            <label for="fname">Forename</label>
            <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname>
            <label for="sname">Surname</label>
            <input type="text" id="sname" name=sfname>
        </form>
    </div>

{{% endblock %}}
